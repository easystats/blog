## see

[We](https://github.com/orgs/easystats/people) have recently decided to collaborate around the new [**easystats project**](https://github.com/easystats), a set of packages designed to make your life *easier*. This project encompasses several packages, devoted for instance to [model access](https://github.com/easystats/insight) or [Bayesian analysis](https://github.com/easystats/bayestestR), [indices of model performance](https://github.com/easystats/performance) or  [visualisation](https://github.com/easystats/see).

***Without further ado, please let us introduce the latest addition to the easyverse; the ***  [**`see`**](https://github.com/easystats/see) ***package!***


<!-- The goal of [`performance`](https://github.com/easystats/performance) is to provide lightweight tools to **assess and check the quality of your model**. It includes functions such as [`R2`](https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/r2.html) for many models (including logistic, mixed and Bayesian models), [`ICC`](https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/icc.html) or helpers to check [`convergence`](https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/check_convergence.html), [`overdipsersion`](https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/check_overdispersion.html) or [`zero-inflation`](https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/check_zeroinflation.html). See the **list of functions** [here](https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/index.html). -->

`see` can be installed as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
install.packages("see")  # Install the package
library(see)  # Load it
```
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(see)
```

More details about `see`'s features are comming soon, stay tuned ;)



## Get Involved

There is definitely room for improvement, and some new exciting features are already planned. Feel free to let us know how we could further improve this package!

To conclude, note that *easystats* is a new project in active development. Thus, do not hesitate to contact us if **you want to get involved :)**
