The [**bayestestR**](https://github.com/easystats/bayestestR) package has several functions to compute indices of effect existence and significance in a Bayesian framework, like [`p_direction()`](https://easystats.github.io/bayestestR/reference/p_direction.html) or [`bayesfactor_parameters()`](https://easystats.github.io/bayestestR/reference/bayesfactor_parameters.html).

The accuracy of these indices is affected by various sources of uncertainty, such as sample size or noise. [Using the package](https://twitter.com/Dom_Makowski/status/1204027373542203394?s=20), we have created a small animation that demontrates how new evidence updates the posterior distribution and thereby indices of existence and significance:

If you'd like to know more (statistical) details about these indices, we have recently published a paper with a simulation study (available for free!), demonstrating how such indices behave in the context of different sources of uncertainty:

In this paper, you'll also find fancy figures like this one, showing the relationship between Bayesian indices and the frequentist *p*-value:
