## Happy birthday easystats!

Two years ago, which feels like yesterday, we celebrated the [**easystats**](https://github.com/easystats/easystats) project's [first anniversary](https://easystats.github.io/blog/posts/easystats_oneyear/). 

Wow, those were simpler times! One could travel for pleasure, party with dozens of people and have a face-to-face conversation, and the thing that spread around the globe like a wildfire was people's obsession with The Weeknd's *Blinding Lights*! 

At any rate, since the pandemic did not affect GitHub in anyway, our free and open-source fanatic souls have made sure that this project keeps progressing, sometimes in leaps and bounds, while other times slow as the white cloud in the sky.

**What happened since? A lot!** 

<!-- Maybe we can say something about... us? Who the team is, what we do, how we work? -->


### We are now in double figures!

**easystats** project, which started out as a single R package, now comprises of a whopping 10 packages! These modular packages, each with its own, unique purview, connect with each other to form a web of packages that provide a unifying, consistent, and most importantly, **easy-to-use** framework for statistical modeling, visualization, and reporting in R!

<!-- knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/easystats/easystats/blob/master/man/figures/logo_wall.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->


Let's see this structure. First, at the bottom, we have the foundation upon which the ecosystem is built:

- [**insight**](https://github.com/easystats/insight): 🔮 This package serves as the foundation of the ecosystem as it allows manipulating objects from different R packages. It is very useful for developers, helping them make their own packages flexibly.
- [**datawizard**](https://github.com/easystats/datawizard): 🧙 The most recent addition! Encompasses utility functions to work with data. *Sounds like the tidyverse to you?* Well kind of, but it has the advantage of being dependency free! Again, a great toolbox to use in your packages.

We then have specialized packages to work with specific types of analyses or compute additional information from statistical models.

- [**bayestestR**](https://github.com/easystats/bayestestR): 👻 Utility tools for dealing with Bayesian statistics.
- [**effectsize**](https://github.com/easystats/effectsize): 🐉 Compute, convert, and interpret effect sizes.
- [**correlation**](https://github.com/easystats/correlation): 🔗 A package dedicated at running and visualizing many types of correlations.
- [**modelbased**](https://github.com/easystats/modelbased): 📈 This package works with predictions from statistical models, and can be used to compute marginal means or run contrast analyses.

The information about statistical models are extracted and aggregated in the following two packages. One of them is made for information about the model as a whole, the other one for information about the parameters within a model.

- [**performance**](https://github.com/easystats/performance): 💪 Compute, analyze and test the performance of a statistical model.
- [**parameters**](https://github.com/easystats/parameters): 📊 Understand your model's parameters and put them in a nice table.

Finally, the two high-level packages are using the rest to help users communicate their statistics, either graphically or textually.

- [**see**](https://github.com/easystats/see): 🎨 This package interfaces with ggplot2 to create visual plots. Most of the time, it is actually used silently in the other packages when calling the `plot()` function on easystats objects.
- [**report**](https://github.com/easystats/report): 📜 🎉 This packages aims at implementing an automated reporting of statistical models.

### Some things we learnt

what did we learn?

**easystats** demonstrates how an open-science project and be born and grow outside the academic system, without funding and publication goals, and with no direct obligation or pressure to work to it. We're all contributing on our free time, with as guiding light an interest in making data science a little bit better.

### Future plans

- V1
- Get funding?
- Polish modelbased
- Polish and add more features to datawizard
- Polish report
- book?




As a closing note, we'd like to thank **you, user of easystats**, for directly contributing to our passion. Cheers!
