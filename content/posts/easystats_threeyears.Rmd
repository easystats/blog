## Happy birthday easystats!

Two years ago, which feels like yesterday, we celebrated the [**easystats**](https://easystats.github.io/easystats) project's [first anniversary](https://easystats.github.io/blog/posts/easystats_oneyear/). 

Wow, those were simpler times! One could travel for pleasure, party with dozens of people and have a face-to-face conversation, and the thing that spread around the globe like a wildfire was people's obsession with The Weeknd's *Blinding Lights*! 

At any rate, since the pandemic did not affect GitHub in anyway, our free and open-source fanatic souls have made sure that this project keeps progressing, sometimes in leaps and bounds, while other times slow as the white cloud in the sky.

**What happened since? A lot!** 

<!-- Maybe we can say something about... us? Who the team is, what we do, how we work? -->


### "Go Forth and Multiply"

**easystats** project, which started out as a single R package, now comprises of a whopping 10 packages! These modular packages, each with its own, unique purview, connect with each other to form a unifying, consistent, and most importantly, **easy-to-use** framework for statistical modeling, visualization, and reporting in R! üï∏Ô∏è

```

Let's take a closer look at this structure. First, at the bottom, we have the foundation packages upon which the ecosystem is built:

- [**insight**](https://easystats.github.io/insight): üîÆ This dependency-free low-level helper package provides a unified portal to extract information about a wide range of statistical models. If you (as a user or a developer) have ever felt frustrated by the diversity of objects in R and the APIs they provide, this is the package for you! 

- [**datawizard**](https://easystats.github.io/datawizard): üßô The most recent addition to the ecosystem! This package form the data wrangling backend for the entire ecosystem and can be just what you are looking for if you want to do `{tidyverse}`-like data wrangling but without gaining dependencies.

We then have specialized packages to work with specific types of analyses or compute additional information from statistical models.

- [**bayestestR**](https://easystats.github.io/bayestestR): üëª Utility tools for manipulating and visualizing Bayesian statistical models.

- [**effectsize**](https://easystats.github.io/effectsize): üêâ A one-stop solution for computing pretty much every effect size know to the mankind, well, almost every üòÖ

- [**correlation**](https://easystats.github.io/correlation): üîó A package dedicated for computing and visualizing probably the most comprehensive suite of correlations.

- [**modelbased**](https://easystats.github.io/modelbased): üìà A utility package to work with predictions from statistical models, and can be used to compute and visualize marginal means or contrast analyses.

The information about statistical models are extracted and aggregated in the following two packages:

- [**performance**](https://easystats.github.io/performance): üí™ Computes, analyzes, and tests the performance of statistical model(s).

- [**parameters**](https://easystats.github.io/parameters): üìä Extracts a comprehensive dataframe of almost any statistical model's parameters and provides helpers to present them in elegant tables and plots.

Finally, the two high-level packages utilize other packages to communicate results from statistical analyses, either graphically or textually.

- [**see**](https://easystats.github.io/see): üé® This package forms the visualization backend for the entire ecosystem and interfaces with *ggplot2* to support plotting methods for various *easystats* objects.

- [**report**](https://easystats.github.io/report): üìú üéâ This packages provides an automated way to create text reports of statistical analyses.

Except for *datawizard*, *report*, and *modelbased* packages, which are still in their teenage years, the rest of the packages are legally permitted to drive your statistical analyse as they have been published in peer-reviewed journals^[You can use `citation()` function to see reference for each package.] and enjoy a regular health checkup with a large suite of unit tests.

### It is used by a lot of people 

To our utmost delight, these package have already been downloaded over 6 million times! It has been an overwhelming experience to see the warm welcome that some of these packages have received in the #rstats community on Twitter and LinkedIn.

### It is used by other packages

Not only is it popular among users, but other developers have also started to take a note of this project for the following primary reasons:

- It has 0 external, non-base hard dependencies.

- Rapid response from our developer team in fixing bugs or supporting feature requests, sometimes even in a matter of hours.

- Great documentation with a plenty of examples and richly detailed tutorials.

So if you have been in two minds thus far about whether you want to use these packages in your package development, we would highly recommends that you get in touch and communicate your concerns with us. We will do our best to assuage them.

### Some things we learnt

* We choose to believe that **easystats** is a rags-to-riches story. An open-science project, conceived by a PhD student, born and nursed in the academic environment with neither funding nor part of anyone's research program, and with no direct obligation or pressure to work on it, has now a global community of many thousands of users. They say necessity is the mother of invention and boy we have tried to be inventive in terms of managing our resources to push out high-quality software in quick period with $0 in funding. Even if we get any funding some day, we will carry these hard-earned lessons with us.

* All of us contribute to this project in our free time and have surprisingly never met each other. This has also taught us about the value, fruitfulness, and the sheer joy of online global collaboration, although all of us live in the West and do enjoy the privilege of good internet connectivity.

### Future plans

This project is now approaching a stage where we can start thinking about finally publishing the meta-package *easystats* on CRAN, which will give users a single entry-point to access the entire ecosystem's functionality. 

After that, we will be ready to release the first stable version (`1.0`) of most - if not all - of our packages. This means there will be less focus on actively adding new features and we will concentrate more on dissemination of the existing features. We are also considering the possibility of writing a book to give a more comprehensive and cohesive account of the project. 

### Acknowledgments

As a closing note, we'd like to thank **you, user of easystats**, for directly contributing to our passion. Cheers!

*...And if you're not yet a user or a contributor... what are you waiting for?!*
