## Happy birthday easystats!

Two years ago, which feels like yesterday, we celebrated the [**easystats**](https://github.com/easystats/easystats) collection of packages [first anniversary](https://easystats.github.io/blog/posts/easystats_oneyear/). These were simpler times, when one could travel around, party and speak to each other face-to-face (or more exactly, *mouth-to-mouth*)... Just kidding, we're open-source geeks, so as long as GitHub is up we have no excuses for not developing our software, right? 

**What happened since? A lot!** 

### It has 10 packages

list and describe?

### It is used by a lot of people 

Usage and its growing popularity

### It is used by other packages

List some of the popular packages that are using us to highlight how useful we are

### Some things we learnt

what did we learn?

**easystats** demonstrates how an open-science project and be born and grow outside the academic system, without funding and publication goals, and with no direct obligation or pressure to work to it. We're all contributing on our free time, with as guiding light an interest in making data science a little bit better.

### Future plans

- V1
- Get funding?
- Polish modelbased
- Polish and add more features to datawizard
- Polish report
- book?




As a closing note, we'd like to thank **you, user of easystats**, for directly contributing to our passion. Cheers!
