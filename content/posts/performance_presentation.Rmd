Indices of model **performance** (*i.e.*, model quality, goodness of fit, predictive accuracy etc.) are very important, both for model *comparison* and model *description* purposes. However, their computation or extraction for a wide variety of models can be complex. 

***To address this, please let us introduce the ***  [**`performance`**](https://github.com/easystats/performance) ***package!***


## performance

[We](https://github.com/orgs/easystats/people) have recently decided to collaborate around the new [**easystats project**](https://github.com/easystats), a set of packages designed to make your life *easier* (currently WIP). This project encompasses several packages, devoted for instance to [model access](https://github.com/easystats/insight) or [Bayesian analysis](https://github.com/easystats/bayestestR), as well as [indices of model performance](https://github.com/easystats/performance).


The goal of [`performance`](https://github.com/easystats/performance) is to provide lightweight tools to **assess and check the quality of your model**. It includes functions such as [`R2`](https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/r2.html) for many models (including logistic, mixed and Bayesian models), [`ICC`](https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/icc.html) or helpers to check [`convergence`](https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/check_convergence.html), [`overdipsersion`](https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/check_overdispersion.html) or [`zero-inflation`](https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/check_zeroinflation.html). See the **list of functions** [here](https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/index.html).

`performance` can be installed as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
install.packages("performance")  # Install the package
library(performance)  # Load it
```
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(performance)
```

## Example

Let's compute **all available** indices of performance appropriate for a given model. This can be done via the [**model_performance**](https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/model_performance.html).


### Mixed Models

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load the lme4 package
library(lme4)

# Fit a mixed model
model <- lmer(Sepal.Width ~ Petal.Length + (1|Species), data = iris)

# Compute performance indices
model_performance(model)
```


### Bayesian Mixed Models

```{r eval = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load the rstanarm package
library(rstanarm)

# Fit a Bayesian mixed model
model <- stan_glmer(Sepal.Width ~ Petal.Length + (1|Species), data = iris)

# Compute performance indices
model_performance(model)
```
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(rstanarm)
junk <- capture.output(model <- stan_glmer(Sepal.Width ~ Petal.Length + (1|Species), data = iris))
model_performance(model)
```



More details about `performance`'s features are comming soon, stay tuned ;)

## Help us

There is definitely room for improvement, and some new exciting features are already planned. Feel free to let us know how we could further improve this package!

To conclude, note that *easystats* is a new project in active development. Thus, do not hesitate to contact us if **you want to get involved :)**
