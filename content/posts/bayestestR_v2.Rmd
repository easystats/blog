## bayestestR v2 is here!

As you might have heard from [previous posts](https://easystats.github.io/blog/posts/), [we](https://github.com/orgs/easystats/people) have recently started to collaborate around the new [**easystats project**](https://github.com/easystats), a set of packages designed to make your life easier. One of the package, [**bayestestR**](https://github.com/easystats/bayestestR), has just been updated on CRAN.

And this release is so **packed with new features** and **improvements** that it would impossible to present them all in one post! We have added the computation of different types of [**Bayes factors (BF)](https://easystats.github.io/bayestestR/articles/bayes_factors.html), new [**plotting methods**](https://github.com/easystats/see#bayestestr) available in the `see` package, a meta-function, [`describe_posterior`](https://easystats.github.io/bayestestR/reference/describe_posterior.html), that compute **everything at once**, and more...

We also improved the **documentation**, with new **tutorials** and **articles** so that Bayesian analysis has no secrets for you. Check them out:

#### Tutorials
