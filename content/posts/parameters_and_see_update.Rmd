## New Features of the parameters and see Package

We're excited to announce some news from the [easystats-project](https://github.com/easystats/easystats). Two packages were updated recently, the [**parameters**-package](https://easystats.github.io/parameters) and our visualization-toolbox, the [**see**-package](http://easystats.github.io/see).

Before we start introducing some of the new features, we'd like to explain why you need the **see**-package to create plots for functions from other *easystats* packages. So, the **see**-package not only includes additional geoms, color scales and themes for **ggplot2**, but - maybe more important - also provides `plot()`-methods for many functions from the various *easystats* packages. By separating the plotting functionality from our core packages, packages from the easystats-project donâ€™t rely nor import any other packages! This means that you can safely use them as dependencies in your own packages, without the risk of butterfly effects (a small change in a distant downstream dependency with unexpected upstream consequences).

## Print and Plot your Model Parameters

The [`model_parameters()`](https://easystats.github.io/parameters/reference/model_parameters.html) function in the **parameters**-package is simlar to `broom::tidy()` - it returns a summary of the model parameters as a clean, consistent data frame. [`standardize_names()`](https://easystats.github.io/parameters/reference/standardize_names.html) can be used to return a data frame with column names as they are used in other packages (like **broom**). 

`model_parameters()` supports many different models, including mixed or Bayesian regression models. It comes with nice `print()` and `plot()` methods.

### Examples - Zero Inflated Mixed Models with glmmTMB

The first example is a zero-inflated mixed model, fitted with the **glmmTMB**-package. `model_parameters()` creates separate tables for different model components (like zero-inflated components).

```{r}
library(glmmTMB)
data(Salamanders)
model <- glmmTMB(
  count ~ spp + mined + (1 | site),
  ziformula = ~mined,
  family = poisson(),
  data = Salamanders
)

model_parameters(model)
```

If only a specific part of the model should be shown, use the `component`-argument.

```{r}
model_parameters(model, component = "zero_inflated")
```

`plot()` creates a so called "forest plot". In case of models with multiple components, parameters are separated into facets by model component.

```{r}
result <- model_parameters(model)
plot(result)
```

### Examples - Bayesian Mixed Models with brms

For the next example, we download a pre-compiled **brms** model to save computation time. For Bayesian models, by default, only "fixed" effects are shown. Using `effects = "all"` and `component = "all"` allows us to display random effects and the parameters of the zero-inflated model part as well.

```{r}
# We download the model to save computation time. Here is the code
# to refit the exact model used below...

# zinb <- read.csv("http://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/fish.csv")
# set.seed(123)
# model <- brm(bf(
#     count ~ persons + child + camper + (1 | persons),
#     zi ~ child + camper + (1 | persons)
#   ),
#   data = zinb,
#   family = zero_inflated_poisson()
# )
brms_model <- insight::download_model("brms_zi_2")
result <- model_parameters(brms_model, effects = "all", component = "all")

result
```

`plot()` now creates four facets by default. Note that plots from the **parameters**-package create forest plots. If you prefer plots that show the complete posterior distribution, you may rather use functions from the **bayestestRR**-package, as shown [here](https://easystats.github.io/see/articles/bayestestR.html).

```{r}
plot(result)
```

You can modify the layout with `n_columns`.

```{r fig.height=9}
plot(result, n_columns = 1)
```

### Examples - Meta-Analysis with metafor

Even results from meta-analyses, using the **metafor**-package, can be visualized with **parameters** and **see**.

```{r}
library(metafor)
d <- data.frame(
  effectsize = c(-0.393, 0.675, 0.282, -1.398),
  standarderror = c(0.317, 0.317, 0.13, 0.36)
)

ma <- rma(yi = effectsize, sei = standarderror, method = "REML", data = d)
result <- model_parameters(ma)

result
```

Above you see the coefficients, their standard errors and the "weight", based on the inverse variance. When you plot the results, the dot-geoms have different sizes, depending on the weight of the study (similar to `metafor::forest()`).

```{r}
plot(result)
```
