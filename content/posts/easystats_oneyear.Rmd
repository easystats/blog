## Happy birthday easystats!


About a year ago, I sadly realised that the R package I was maintaining ([*psycho*](https://github.com/neuropsychology/psycho.R)) was drifting more and more away from its original scope, getting drown under a pile of unrelated and under-documented features that I kept on adding as my R skills improved. **Something had to be done.**


I decided to get in touch with Daniel, aka **strengejacke** (for mysterious and very confusing reasons), the author of the [*sjverse*](https://github.com/strengejacke), a collection of great packages which scope wasn't too distant from my own one. Quickly, we realised that we shared similar issues, as well as the same vision: **make R stats easy again**.

We also agreed on how to reach this goal, by building a new collection of packages that would work together to create a smooth experience to getting things done in R (note that we prefered the workflow to be *easy* rather than *tidy*... ;p). Most importantly, we shared the same values, including a commitment to open-science, a desire for collaborative developpment, a focus on user- and beginner-friendlienes, and a dedication to the Force.

And just like that, [**easystats was born**](https://github.com/orgs/easystats/).


But this project wouldn't have grown, nor still exist, if we hadn't manage to bring in the **most talented people**, creating an awesome [team](https://github.com/orgs/easystats/people) which diversity in experience, and skills offers an increadibly valuable resource. Shout-out to the ultimate Bayes master [@mattansb](https://github.com/mattansb), to our socio-political expert [@pdwaggoner](https://github.com/pdwaggoner), to [@IndrajeetPatil](https://twitter.com/patilindrajeets), the compulsive model supporter and author of the famous [*ggstatsplot*](https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/ggstatsplot), to our big-daddy-markdown-mate [@humanfactors](https://twitter.com/humanfactorsio), to the best dinosaur stats explainer  [@lindeloev](https://twitter.com/jonaslindeloev) and to the [*interaction*](https://github.com/jacob-long/interactions) genius [@jacob-long](https://twitter.com/jacobandrewlong). A big thank you to the team, and make sure to check-out their awesome work and research!


In one year, we created **9 packages**, pushed 7 of them to **CRAN** (that have now been downloaded more than **half a million times** *(!!!)*), wrote many [**blogposts**](https://easystats.github.io/blog/posts/), and made like a thousand [**memes**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/easystats/easystats/master/man/figures/misc/notthememe.jpg). But most importantly, we **learned a lot**. This project was the opportunity for us to drastically improve our R, stats, programming and human skills. Moreover, this was a great occasion to have **fun**, contribute to the **community**, and become part of a **network** of talented and open-minded people with similar interests. And that's one of the biggest take-away!

That doesn't mean that there are no academic outcomes. This year, we published **3 papers** related to easystats. And we plan on keeping at least that rythm for the year to come *(now might be your chance to get involved ;)*. We also plan on releasing the remaining packages (and fixing [*report*](https://github.com/easystats/report), I know XD), continue improving the existing ones and adding more awesome features and documentation.

All in all, **easystats** is a living demonstration of how an open-science project can be born and keep growing. And it's against all odds in the current academic system! We have **no funding** (however, very interested in getting some... *\*wink wink\**) nor academic pressure related to it, we are all contributing to it on our **free time**, out of pure enthusiasm and interest in making this place better. 

So, as a closing note, Because happiness is only useful if it is shared, we'd like to thank **you, user of easystats**, for directly contributing to our passion. Cheers!

*...And if you're not yet a user or a contributor... what are you waiting for???*
