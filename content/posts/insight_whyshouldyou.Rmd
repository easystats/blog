## What is it?

We are talking about the [**insight package**](https://github.com/easystats/insight). It is what allows other packages, like **easystats** ([parameters](https://github.com/easystats/parameters), [effectsize](https://github.com/easystats/effectsize), [performance](https://github.com/easystats/performance), [report](https://github.com/easystats/report), ...) or [**ggstatsplot**](https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/ggstatsplot), [**sjstats**](https://github.com/strengejacke/sjstats/) or  [**modelsummary**](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/modelsummary) to be as powerful as they are, supporting tons of different R models. So why make you life hard when you can be like them, and rely on **insight**?

It is made for developers (and users) that do some **postprocessing** of different models (e.g., extracting stuff like parameters, values, data, names, specifications, predictions, priors, etc.), whether it is to nicely display their results or to do further computation.

If you work with, and around, different R models, then **this package is a must-have that will change your life**.

## What's the problem

Because R has so many different packages, different models were implemented by different people in a different way. As a consequence, there are different ways of accessing the same stuff from each model.

For example, let's say you want to find the **names of the predictors** (the independent variables) of a linear model. One way would be like this:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model_lm <- lm(mpg ~ drat * wt, data=mtcars)

names(model_lm$model)[-1]
```

But what in the case of a lme4's mixed model? Well the solution is a bit different, plus it's not easy to drop the random factors...

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model_lmer <- lme4::lmer(mpg ~ drat * wt + (1|cyl), data=mtcars)

names(model_lmer@frame)[-1]
```

And what in the case of a GAMM4's general additive model?

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model_gam <- gamm4::gamm4(mpg ~ drat + wt + s(qsec), data=mtcars)

head(names(model_gam$gam$model)[-1], -3)
```

Again different! Maybe you could do something like that, but then you have to account for **all the edgecases** and so on. And trust us, **that's a lot of work** to have a robust and bug-free solution.


## How 'insight' addresses it

**insight** allows you to extract stuff from all models in a consistent and robust way. For instance, for the fixed predictors of the examples above, here's how you would do it with insight:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(insight)

find_predictors(model_lm)
find_predictors(model_lmer)
find_predictors(model_gam)
```

**Boom!** One function that works for all the models. And that's not all, **insight** can help you extract data, parameters, intercepts, degrees of freedom, sigma, variance, predicted values, variable names, interaction terms, random factors, smooth terms, etc. etc. Basically, everything you might need. And if what you need is not there, just [**ask for it**](https://github.com/easystats/insight/issues).

You can check all that **insight** can do [**here**](https://easystats.github.io/insight/reference/index.html).

## More reasons to use it

If you're worried about adding a new dependency to your package, don't be! Because **insight** is super light: it itself has **no dependencies**. So it's a safe choice to add and rely on!

It includes other useful **features that you don't know you absolutely need**, like value formatting, nice printing of text, table and data.frames exporting and much more! Check out them [**here**](https://easystats.github.io/insight/reference/index.html).
