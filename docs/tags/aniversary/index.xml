      <description>Happy birthday easystats!Two years ago, which feels like yesterday, we celebrated the easystats project’s first anniversary.
Wow, those were simpler times! One could travel for pleasure, party with dozens of people and have a face-to-face conversation, and the thing that spread like a wildfire around the globe was everyone’s obsession with The Weeknd’s Blinding Lights!
At any rate, since the pandemic did not affect GitHub in any way, our free and open-source fanatic souls have made sure that this project keeps progressing, sometimes in leaps and bounds, while other times slow as grey clouds in the sky.</description>

      <description>Happy birthday easystats!About a year ago, I (Dom) sadly realised that the R package I was maintaining (psycho) was drifting more and more away from its original scope, getting drown under a pile of unrelated and under-documented features that I kept on adding as my R skills improved. Something had to be done.
I decided to get in touch with Daniel, aka strengejacke (for mysterious and very confusing reasons), the author of the sjverse, a collection of awesome packages which scope wasn’t too distant from my own one.</description>
