      <description>Happy birthday easystats!About a year ago, I (Dom) sadly realised that the R package I was maintaining (psycho) was drifting more and more away from its original scope, getting drown under a pile of unrelated and under-documented features that I kept on adding as my R skills improved. Something had to be done.
I decided to get in touch with Daniel, aka strengejacke (for mysterious and very confusing reasons), the author of the sjverse, a collection of awesome packages which scope wasnâ€™t too distant from my own one.</description>
