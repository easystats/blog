      <description>Many times, for instance when teaching, I needed to quickly and simply generate a perfectly normally distributed sample to illustrate or show some of its characteristics.
This is now very easy to do with the new bayestestR package, which includes the rnorm_perfect function. This function is very similar to the classic rnorm (same arguments), with the difference that the generated sample is perfectly normal.
ExamplebayestestR can be installed as follows:</description>

      <description>The Bayesian framework is quickly gaining popularity among scientists, leading to the growing popularity of packages to fit Bayesian models, such as rstanarm or brms. However, extracting summary indices from these models to report them in your manuscript can be quite challenging, especially for new users.
To address this, please let us introduce bayestestR!
bayestestRWe have recently decided to collaborate around the new easystats project, a set of packages designed to make your life easier (currently very WIP).</description>
