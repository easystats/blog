      <description>The richness and variety of packages for building and fitting statistical models in R is absolutely astonishing and contributes to the language’s popularity. However, this diversity makes it hard for developpers that want to create tools that work with different types of models. Indeed, the way to access models’ internal information (such as parameters names, formulae, data, etc.) is not unified, forcing the developers to spend some time figuring out how to do it for each model type.</description>

      <title>The end of errors in ANOVA reporting</title>

      <description>Psychological science is still massively using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Despite its relative simplicity, I am very often confronted to errors in its reporting, for instance in student’s theses or manuscripts, or even published papers (See the excellent statcheck to quickly check the stats of a paper). Beyond the incomplete or just wrong reporting, one can find a tremendous amount of genuine errors (that could influence the results and their interpretation).</description>

      <description>One of the most time-consuming part of data analysis in science is the copy-pasting of specific values of some R output to a manuscript or a report. This task is frustrating, prone to errors, and increases the variability of statistical reporting. At the sime time, standardizing practices of what and how to report is crucial for reproducibility and clarity. The new report package was designed specifically to do this job.</description>
