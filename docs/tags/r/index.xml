      <title>The &#39;see&#39; package: beautiful figures for easystats</title>

      <description>The see packageWe have recently decided to collaborate around the new easystats project, a set of packages designed to make your life easier. This project encompasses several packages, devoted for instance to model access or Bayesian analysis, indices of model performance or visualisation.
Without further ado, please let us introduce the latest addition to the easyverse; the see package!
Essentially, see is the visualisation companion to other functions and packages in easystats.</description>

      <title>A perfectly normally distributed sample: another post?</title>

      <description>Recently, we published a post presenting a small convenience function, from the bayestestR package. This function, named rnorm_perfect, generated an empirical distribution (i.e., a vector of values) as close as possible to a desired distribution, in this case the normal distribution.
It worked like this:
# Generate a perfect samplex &amp;lt;- rnorm_perfect(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1)# Visualise itlibrary(tidyverse)x %&amp;gt;% density() %&amp;gt;% # Compute density functionas.</description>

      <description>Indices of model performance (i.e., model quality, goodness of fit, predictive accuracy etc.) are very important, both for model comparison and model description purposes. However, their computation or extraction for a wide variety of models can be complex.
To address this, please let us introduce the  performance package!

      <title>How to easily generate a perfectly normal distribution</title>

      <description>Many times, for instance when teaching, I needed to quickly and simply generate a perfectly normally distributed sample to illustrate or show some of its characteristics.
This is now very easy to do with the new bayestestR package, which includes the rnorm_perfect function. This function is very similar to the classic rnorm (same arguments), with the difference that the generated sample is perfectly normal.
ExamplebayestestR can be installed as follows:</description>

      <description>The Bayesian framework is quickly gaining popularity among scientists, leading to the growing popularity of packages to fit Bayesian models, such as rstanarm or brms. However, extracting summary indices from these models to report them in your manuscript can be quite challenging, especially for new users.
To address this, please let us introduce bayestestR!

      <title>A unified syntax for accessing models&#39; information</title>

      <description>The richness and variety of packages for building and fitting statistical models in R is absolutely astonishing and contributes to the language’s popularity. However, this diversity makes it hard for developpers that want to create tools that work with different types of models. Indeed, the way to access models’ internal information (such as parameters names, formulae, data, etc.) is not unified, forcing the developers to spend some time figuring out how to do it for each model type.</description>
