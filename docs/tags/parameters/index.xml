But the parameters package, finally on CRAN, already has some cool features!
parametersWe have recently decided to collaborate around the easystats project, a set of packages designed to make your life easier. This project encompasses several packages, devoted for instance to model internal access, Bayesian analysis, as well as indices of model performance and quality.</description>
