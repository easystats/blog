        The easystats project continues to grow, expanding its capabilities and features, and the parameters package 0.2.0 update is now on CRAN.
The primary goal of this package is to provide utilities for processing the parameters of various statistical models. It is useful for end-users as well as developers, as it is a lightweight and open-developed package.
The main function, model_parameters(), can be seen as an alternative to broom::tidy().

        Okay, “an alternative to broom” might be a bit of an overstatement (at least for now…)
But the parameters package, finally on CRAN, already has some cool features!

        The goal of performance is to provide lightweight tools to assess and check the quality of your model. It includes functions such as r2() for many models (including logistic, mixed and Bayesian models), icc() or helpers to check_convergence(), check_overdipsersion() or check_zero-inflation() (see a complete list of functions here).
In this posting, we want to focus on multicollinearity. Multicollinearity “is a phenomenon in which one predictor variable in a multiple regression model can be linearly predicted from the others” (source), i.

        The Problem with Null EffectsSay you fit an ANOVA model, predicting the time it takes to solve a puzzle from its shape (round / square) and whether it was colored or black and white, and you found that one of the estimated effects, in this case the interaction, was not significant. Say even that it was as non-significant as can be, with p = 1.00!

        bayestestR 0.2 is here!As you might have heard from previous posts, we have recently started to collaborate around the new easystats project, a suite of packages designed to make your life easier. One of the packages, bayestestR, has just been updated on CRAN.
And this release is so packed with new features and improvements that it would be impossible to present them all in one post! We have added the computation of different types of Bayes factors (BF), new plotting methods (available in the see package), a new meta-function, describe_posterior, that computes everything at once, and more…

Without further ado, please let us introduce the latest addition to the easyverse; the see package!

        Recently, we published a post presenting a small convenience function, from the bayestestR package. This function, named rnorm_perfect, generated an empirical distribution (i.e., a vector of values) as close as possible to a desired distribution, in this case the normal distribution.
It worked like this:
# Generate a perfect samplex &lt;- rnorm_perfect(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1)# Visualise itlibrary(tidyverse)x %&gt;% density() %&gt;% # Compute density functionas.

        Indices of model performance (i.e., model quality, goodness of fit, predictive accuracy etc.) are very important, both for model comparison and model description purposes. However, their computation or extraction for a wide variety of models can be complex.
To address this, please let us introduce the  performance package!

        Many times, for instance when teaching, I needed to quickly and simply generate a perfectly normally distributed sample to illustrate or show some of its characteristics.
This is now very easy to do with the new bayestestR package, which includes the rnorm_perfect function. This function is very similar to the classic rnorm (same arguments), with the difference that the generated sample is perfectly normal.
ExamplebayestestR can be installed as follows:

        The Bayesian framework is quickly gaining popularity among scientists, leading to the growing popularity of packages to fit Bayesian models, such as rstanarm or brms. However, extracting summary indices from these models to report them in your manuscript can be quite challenging, especially for new users.
To address this, please let us introduce bayestestR!
