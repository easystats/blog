      <description>Recently, Daniel (author of great packages such as sjPlot and ggeffects) and I (from the psycho package), decided to unite our forces to provide flexible, stable and lightweight tools for facilitating data analysis. The easystats project, altough in very active developpement, already contains some useful functions.
One of such can help creating pretty correlation graphs and plots. correlation is a small package designed to compute correlations in a format that can easily be fed into plotting packages.</description>
